USER UPLOADS a myanimelist profile

"sign in with myanimelist"

1 button reccomends from whole list = click it and shit processes

Gives back list of most reccomended shows AND comments on said show

MAKE SURE TO WEIGHT SCORES
(above 5) weight more favorable.
(below 5) less favorable.
(is a 5) no preference.


LET USER apply only certain shows
1. by score
2. by genre
3. by explicit name (some sort of way to checkmark shit sounds dank)

OPTIONS
1. either have whole database already
anime (recs, comment)
recs = myanimelist, reddit, etc

2. dynamically find it depending on user input (maybe cache results)



let's try making my own api first since that seems like a more dank solution
api will update every week or some shit (using celery)



GET request (anime as argument)
gets the reccomendations for other animes


DATABASE

ANIME
list of [rec-anime]


REC-ANIME
#num recs
#source (start with just myanimelist then maybe just add reddit and other shit)




HOSINTG
ec2 instance with database and these scripts
ec2 instance for the api
another ec2 instance for the website

connect with aws RDS


THE AI PORTION
can probably brute force it for initial testing.
try to get people to use it to get data...



LAST PART
once you have a training set though try apply collaborative filtering algorithm
